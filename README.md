# SPARTAN Phase 1

## Overview

This is an early demo of the **SPARTAN** project, focusing on enhancing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomy. The project utilizes various methods to improve functionality, including Kalman filtering for sensor fusion and real-time tracking capabilities.

## Features

- **Kalman Filtering**: Improves accuracy in UAS target tracking and localization.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized algorithms to enhance autonomy in UAS operations.
- **Edge Computing**: Designed for lightweight, efficient computation suitable for smaller UAVs.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Contains the user interface components.
- **Backend (app.py)**: Contains core functionality, including the Kalman filter implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python** installed on your system (version 3.x recommended)
- Optional: Create and activate a virtual environment
- **Google Maps API Key**: To use the mapping features in this demo, you will need a Google Maps API key. [Get your API key here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JpaulCRN/SPARTAN_1.git
   cd SPARTAN_1
