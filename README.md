# Spartan Phase 1 
Overview
This is an early demo of the SPARTAN project, focusing on enhancing Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomy. The project utilizes various methods to improve functionality, including Kalman filtering for sensor fusion and real-time tracking capabilities.

Features
Kalman Filtering: Improves accuracy in UAS target tracking and localization.
Real-Time Processing: Optimized algorithms to enhance autonomy in UAS operations.
Edge Computing: Designed for lightweight, efficient computation suitable for smaller UAVs.
Project Structure
Frontend: Contains the user interface components.
Backend (app.py): Contains core functionality, including the Kalman filter implementation.
